# Vehicle-to-grid-V2G-
A simulink model of a V2G converter and a controller for a simulated battery load.


## **OBJECTIVES** 
1. Simulation of Plug-In Electric Vehicle Bidirectional Off-Board Charger
2. Vehicle to grid reactive power operation simulation.
3. Reduced THD of the input side
4. Design a control system to fulfill above objectives which would provide a good steady state performance and a fast dynamic response whenever required. 



## **To simulate different conditions we have taken 4 instances: **
1. A normal 2.1kW load (0s to 1s)
2. Load increases to 4.5kW (1s to 2s)
3. load reduces to 2.1kW (2s to 3s)
4. The load starts delivering 1kW power to the grid (3s to 4s)
